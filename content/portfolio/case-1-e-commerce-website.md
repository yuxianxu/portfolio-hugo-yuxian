shortDescription: Zonama is a full-featured e-commerce app like amazon. It is also a full stack project with NextJS, MongoDB, paypal gateway, google map, and Material UI(MUI).
challenge: Two challenges I have for this online shopping app. First, I used lots of hooks to set states. Second is user authentication. Both of them need patience and time to implement.
solution: I separate the project to several tasks and complete one by one. It's great to see the process for each commit.
